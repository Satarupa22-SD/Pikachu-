First Part ( Import, gajurel() and part 1 of the class ):
First, import the turtle module and create a function named “gajurel” with the parameters (x, y). Inside this function, set the x of the turtle to “x” and y of the turtle to “y.” Then, print the x and y.
Create a class named Cartoon. Inside this class, create an initializer __init__. Inside this function, set “t” as the turtle and set the pen size to 3 and speed to 9. Never forget that functions inside a class always have a parameter “self.” Now, on drag, call the gajurel function.
Create another function named meme() with the parameters self, x, and y. inside this function, pick the pen up and go to (x, y), and put the pen down.
Likewise, create another function named aankha1() with the parameters self, x, and y. Inside this function, call the meme() function with the arguments (x, y). Set “self.t” as “t”. Call the seth() method with the angle of 0 degrees and fill the part with the color#333333 and begin the fill. Draw a circle(22) and end the fill. Again, call the meme() function with the arguments (x, y+10) and fill the part with the color #000000 ( black ), and begin the fill. Create a circle(10) and end the fill. Again, call the meme() function with the arguments (x+6, y+22) and fill the part with the color #ffffff ( white ) and begin the fill. Create a circle(10) and end the fill.
Similarly, create another function named aankha2() with the parameters self, x, and y. Inside this function, call the meme() function with the arguments x and y. Then, set “self.t” as “t.” Now, call the seth() method with the angle of 0 and fill the part with the color #333333 and begin the fill. Draw a circle(22) and end the fill. Continuing, call the meme() function with the arguments x, y+19 and fill the part with the color #00000 ( black ) and begin the fill. Draw a circle(10) and end the fill. Similarly, call the meme() function again with the arguments (x-6, y + 22) and fill the part with the color #ffffff ( white ) and begin the fill. Draw a circle(10) and end the flll.
